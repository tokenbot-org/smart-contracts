TKB ERC-20 Smart Contract Source code

TKB is the native smart contract for TokenBot. TKB enables TokenBot traders to receive 100% of the subscription price when copy-traders sign up to follow them. Normally TokenBot takes a 30% fee on every subscription paid in fiat via Stripe. In this scenario, TKB serves as an incentive token for our most loyal traders of the plaform â€” enabling them to accept payments in crypto and receive all the revenue.
